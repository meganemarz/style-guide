# Rush Content Guide

This is a sample to show what a Rush Content Guide could look like, and to make voice and tone guidelines accessible on the web.



## Voice and Tone

**Voice** is like a person’s voice. Just as you can instantly identify your coworker when you hear them at the end of the hall, readers should be able to recognize Rush’s voice. A well-crafted voice communicates personality and values — it’s a distilled representation of an organization.

**Tone** is more like attitude — the emotional context of what you’re saying.

This guide was created by communicators across Rush to help you write, edit and speak in a way that reflects Rush’s voice and hits the right tone for your audiences.

# Rush's voice

Rush’s voice expresses our personality and values. Here’s how we define it:

**Approachable** 
Our writing is clear, concise and conversational. We commonly use active voice, contractions and the second person. We avoid or explain terms our audiences might not understand.

**Authoritative**
We check our facts, cite evidence of our claims and make sure our message is consistent with other Rush communications. 

**Caring**
We’re sensitive to our audiences and adapt our communications to their needs. 

**Genuine** 
We don’t use clichés or buzzwords. Instead, we try to find a more precise way of expressing what we want to say.

**Inclusive**
Our language is respectful and welcoming to all members of our audiences.

# Voice checklist

Whether you’re looking over your own work or reviewing someone else’s, ask yourself each of these questions — and make sure the answer is yes:

- Does this sound like something a person would naturally say? Read it out loud to make sure.

- Does this include concrete specifics wherever possible to support any general claims?

- In addition to sounding like Rush, does this sound right for its audience? If you’re not sure, check the tone guidelines on the following pages.

- Does this favor the active voice (we made mistakes) over the passive voice (mistakes were made)?

- Do you think people of all races, genders, sexual orientations, ages, abilities, nationalities, religions and class backgrounds will feel welcomed and included when they read this? If you’re not sure, consulting the Conscious Style Guide (consciousstyleguide.com) might help.

- Does this use the same terms that other Rush communications use for the same ideas and services? Check rush.edu or inside.rush.edu to make sure.
